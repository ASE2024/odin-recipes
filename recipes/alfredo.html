    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a recipe for homemade Alfredo sauce. My favorite pastas to use are 
        spaghetti and penne, and my favorite proteins to use are shrimp and chicken. However, 
        you can accomapny this sauce with any pasta or protein of your choosing. 
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Info</h2>

    <p>It's important to make sure that you stir the sauce constantly. You want 
        to make sure and avoid boiling in this process as it will affect the consistency
        of the sauce. 
    </p>
    <p>This entire cooking process should take 10-15min, so you will want to have already 
        started your pasta and protein to ensure they are completed around the same time.
