    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe plays right off of the <a href="white_rice.html">White Rice</a>
    recipe. You will want to pay spectial attention to the additional info on
that recipe and make sure that you add the frozen vegetables mentioned there.</p>

<p>I would also reccomend a carbon steel wok that's well seasoned for this meal.
    Of course, that's certainly not a requirement, but will just make this dish
    easier. Any large pan will do the job.

<ul>
    <li>Already cooked <a href="white_rice.html">White Rice</a></li>

    <li>Drizzle some oil in the pan and start on medium heat</li>
    <li>Once your oil is heated and lightly smoking add your diced onion</li>
