    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is going to be for a delicious and simple white rice that
        is a great foundation for just about any dish. Versitile, cheap, and easy.
        This recipe works well with enriched, basmati, long grain, jasmine,
        and sushi rice, as far as I know. But will not work with brown rice.
    </p>
    <p>You may notice the recipe does not mention measurements, and that is 
        because its scalable depending on how many people you're cooking for.
        The rule of thumb, is that one cup uncooked makes enough for 3-4 servings.
        Ther ration is, One cup of uncooked rice calls for 1.5 cups of water. 
    </p>

        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Chicken boillon seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Cook until water is gone, (approximately 6-12min)</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Additional Info</h2>

    <p>I would highly recommend using a rice cooker, as it makes this a VERY
        straightforward and easy process, and allows you to focus more on your 
        other portions of the meal, like your protein, vegetables, and salad. 
        However, if you do not have a rice cooker, a simple saucpan will do. 
        Keep in mind that the rice will rice quite a bit as it cooks, so make
        sure the sauce pan you use is deep enough.
    </p>
    <p>An easy way to jazz this up is the buy a bag of frozen corn, green beans,
        and carrots. You simply add the forzen contenst to the rice after you rinse it,
        and it will cook in with the rice.
